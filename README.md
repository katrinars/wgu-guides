# Katrina's BSCS Guides

#### These guides are a copied and slightly revised (formatting) version of my Notion sheets that are mentioned throughout student forums. I graduated from WGU's BSCS program in May 2024, so some parts of these guides may be outdated. I'd recommend prioritizing instructions within the WGU course instructions over anything mentioned here if there is a conflict.
